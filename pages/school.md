**How to do well in school**

These are some tips I’ve written for myself throughout my (ongoing) studies, which I figured might be useful to someone else. I think they’re most relevant for calculus 1-3, linear algebra, chemistry, etc. — generally, courses which are applications-heavy (i.e., courses where you get a good grade by grinding textbook problems). As I move to more conceptual math classes, I’m finding some parts more relevant, some parts less. (For example, trying to get through real analysis by reading the textbook instead of going to class sounds like a pretty bad idea).

**Do practice problems throughout the semester.** There’s no getting around this one, if you do one thing from this list, it’s gotta be this one.

**Go to class, sit in the front row, ask questions.** This is hard, for the reason professors will never tell you: there is such a thing as a stupid question. Maybe you don’t get the example cause you’re struggling with algebra you should have understood two years ago. Maybe you forgot the thing you spent all of last week on. Suck it up, ask the question and look dumb, cause I promise you’ll feel a lot dumber if you fail the class.

Almost as importantly, this allows you to practice an important meta-skill: taming the shame mammoth. That being said, I like to sit in the front row cause it’s less embarrassing to hesitantly voice the answer to a question no one has answered than to raise your hand to do so.

Also, **take notes**. It doesn’t matter if they’re messy, the objective of taking notes in class is forcing yourself to follow along. It is amazing how quickly the “Yeah that’s pretty obvious, I don’t need to write that down” add up to “what is going on.” You’ll know what’s important and what isn’t by the end of the chapter — for now, suck it up and write.

The most important thing you can do in class is **make mistakes:** follow along, try to solve the examples yourself, figure out why and how you made mistakes. Ask questions if there’s something you don’t understand, or go and see the professor afterwards. If it’s a small class, ask questions that summarize your understanding by rephrasing an idea, to make sure you understand.

Same goes for tutorials. Learning is a contact sport — turning your brain off and copying the blackboard is generally a waste of time. Again, a lot of this tends to be easier when you sit up front.

That being said, I sometimes instead suggest that you:

**Don’t go to class, read the textbook instead.** Going to class takes a lot of time and energy, and undergraduate-level textbooks are usually quite good. I did this more at the start of my journey, when “going to class” meant sitting in the back and zoning out. That being said, I think this is a really good option, kind of like doing HIIT training for sports. But you have to be serious about it, and fairly self-motivated. It can backfire spectacularly though, so if you aren’t sure, go to class. Also, go to office hours.

If you do this, **make sure you have some way of knowing what was covered in class**. Sometimes a prof will really focus on a topic which the textbook barely touches on. Sometimes they’ll skip a topic entirely and you’ll have spent a day learning it for nothing. Going to office hours is worth double

**Rewrite your notes.** Make a list of every topic you’ve covered so far, and go over them as if you were explaining them to a friend. Find a relevant exercise for each big idea. Do this multiple times. I must have done it about ten times to really internalize how to derive multivariate density functions.

**Get** **a solutions manual.** These will usually be available on the same websites you find textbook PDFs. If you can’t find one for your specific textbook, do exercises from a similar textbook for which you can get a solutions manual.

**Go to office hours.** Don’t just show up confused, bring the prof your detailed work (e.g., a question you’ve spent some time on, or an exam question you got wrong). I’ve found asking a prof to explain a concept I didn’t understand previously is unlikely to help, but if I show up with mistakes, they can usually figure out where I went wrong.

**Maintain good habits.** Exercise. Sleep 8 hours. To make this easier, **make a schedule.** One thing I didn’t anticipate about having a schedule is it makes easier to segment stress. It’s nice to be able to go “I’m not going to think about the calculus homework right now, because I’m doing chemistry. I’ll stress about calculus at 2pm.”

**Make friends.** If only to help you realize that this is hard because it’s hard, not because you’re dumb. But also because friends are, y’know, nice to have.

**Figure out what this class is about.** Many people (teachers, most notably) encourage reading the textbook chapter about to be covered in advance. I find it takes a lot of mental energy to work through the textbook myself, and if I’ve done it properly I don’t really learn much in class. But I do think having a general familiarity with what’s about to be covered is very helpful (e.g., being able to visualize what different operations represent, or what they’re useful for). So before the semester starts, try finding a high-level overview of what you’ll be going over in class. What is linear algebra about? What is the big idea in integral calculus? If you can answer these questions, it’ll help you tie together the more abstract ideas, and serve as a through-line when things get murky.

**Do the syllabus exercises, do the hard conceptual exercises**. If you can’t be bothered, at least give them a few minutes and check the solution. Work through the solution yourself and make sure you understand why it’s true. Understanding these problems will deepen your understanding of the material a lot more than just memorizing the tricks to solving the basic stuff. If you can spare the time, avoid doing the graded homework right away, because you’re less likely to do textbook exercises afterwards. Many students fail because they only do the graded homework and expect the exam to be similar. Unfortunately, it often isn’t.

**Check the answer before reading through the solution**. If you got it wrong or couldn’t make progress, now you have a hint. If the problem was tricky, check the solution whether or not you got the right answer, sometimes the author uses a different method to solve it.

**Learn when to check the solution and when to push through**. This will be different for every class: for example in calculus 1, I found that if I was struggling with a limit for more than 20 minutes, I was probably missing an important tool and more time wasn’t going to help. But in calculus 2, if I was struggling with an integral, there was usually something else I could try and it was worth spending more time. Which ties in to my next point:

**Don’t bother with exercises to which you don’t have the answer**, unless you think you can guarantee your answer is right (for example, proof-type questions are more doable even if you can’t check solutions). You’ll spend too much time trying to figure out if you did it properly.

**Don’t ignore mistakes**, give them some thoughts before you erase them. Especially with more conceptual classes, a mistake usually highlights a specific gap or error in your understanding. Why did you think this was true? Why is it not?

**Take breaks properly.** It sucks to spend a day at your desk, books open, unable to focus. You won’t get anything done, and won’t feel like you’ve had a break. If you can afford it and feel like you really won’t get anything done, take the morning, afternoon, or day off. On the other hand, really **make a concerted effort to keep work time and break time separate**. When you take a break, get up and go somewhere else. Your work space is for working, and it’s important you respect that. One hour of focused work is worth _much_ more than two hours where you’re constantly switching between your phone and your homework. I’ve found setting a timer and logging how many hours I work each day works really well, since I have to consciously stop the timer if I want a break, and I naturally try to beat my “high score” studying time.

**Work through questions by reasoning** instead of just trying to remember the “template” for solving this kind of problem. Can you define every word in the question? What will your answer represent? Is there another way to solve this? I like to write out how I’m solving the question, especially if I don’t really know where to start. I find it really cements concepts in my mind. I try and do this on 3-hole punch paper so I can add them to my notes afterwards (re-emphasis on notes being a record of how you’ve come to understand difficult concepts). If you can properly explain every question you solve, exam curveballs become much easier — you actually _understand_ the topics you’ve learnt, not just memorized how to solve a few examples.

**Make a “best-practice” list that works for you.** I started this list as a reminder to myself of what I should be doing, because it’s easy to just… not do those things. Some of my tips might strike you as terrible. Good! Make a list where you outline how _you_ should go about school, and share it with others.
