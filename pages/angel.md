# The Angel Problem #

I got an undergraduate research grant to study the angel problem, as described by John Conway. Iâ€™ve developed an interactive tool in Python to explore the problem and illustrate parts of the proof. [Click here](https://etiennedyer.github.io/assets/angel/angel-1-game.py) to download the Python file. Requires the pygame library.
Use WASD to move in a straight line, QEZC to move diagonally, left click to burn a square, right click to highlight.
