# The Angel Problem #

I got an undergraduate research grant to study the angel problem, as described by John Conway, under Nadia Lafrenière and Assaf Shani. I’ve developed an interactive tool in Python to explore the problem and illustrate parts of the proof. [Click here](https://etiennedyer.github.io/assets/angel/angel-1-game.py) to download the Python file. Requires the pygame library.
Use WASD to move in a straight line, QEZC to move diagonally, left click to burn a square, right click to highlight.

I used the program to create these [slides](https://etiennedyer.github.io/assets/angel/slides.pdf), which I presented to the [LACIM](https://lacim.uqam.ca/fr/index.html) combinatorics summer school.
