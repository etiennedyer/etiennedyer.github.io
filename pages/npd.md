## The Societal Causes of Narcissistic Personality Disorder

It's quite difficult to get data that's comparable across countries, so I've been trying to look at regional effects and what they correlate with. The large-sample studies I've found so far are the [Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557663/) and [DSM-IV personality disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.09.019) for the US (though that second study found a prevalence of 0,0% in a sample of 9282 which leads me to question their methodology), and [The Prevalence of Personality Disorders in a Community Sample](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11386989/) for Norway. These focus mainly on comorbidity with other personality disorders and the effects of social class, so I feel like there's more to be discovered there. Would also love to have a breakdown by type (grandiose vs covert), but I think it would be very hard to get any interesting conclusions without doing a study from scratch.
