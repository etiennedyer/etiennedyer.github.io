# Statistical modelling, econometrics, stuff

## What I'm working on

**Liquidity risk:** using Monte Carlo methods to model the behaviour of a portfolio, with individual assets and liabilities correlated to macro indicators to evaluate the probability of bankruptcy. Currently just a demo, working on automating data fetching and implementing a GUI.

**Narcissistic personality disorder:** the etiology is poorly understood, but a common hypothesis is that it's much more prevalent in societies which highly value individual achievement (US, Japan, China, etc.). It's quite difficult to get data that's comparable across countries (the best data set for the US seems to be the _Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions_), so I've been trying to look at regional effects and what they correlate with. A lot of the studies focus on comorbidity with other personality disorders and social class, so I feel like there's more to be discovered there. Would also love to have a breakdown by type (grandiose vs covert), but I think it would be very hard to get any interesting conclusions without doing a study from scratch.

**ULAB recycling:** I'm working with [students at the university of Chicago](https://leadbatteries.substack.com/) on reforming policy in Nigeria surrounding lead-acid battery recycling. It is a very toxic industry that's quite hard to regulate effectively, but the upsides to making thing a bit better are pretty considerable.
