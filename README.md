## What I'm working on

**[Statistics:](/stats.md)** Analysis and visualization of data sets.

**[Narcissistic personality disorder:](/projects/npd.md)** there hasn't been much research into what causes NPD on a social scale, so I've been aggregating and analyzing studies.

**[ULAB recycling:](https://leadbatteries.substack.com/)** I'm working with students at the university of Chicago on reforming policy in Nigeria surrounding lead-acid battery recycling.
