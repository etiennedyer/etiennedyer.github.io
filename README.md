## [Weaver](https://weaver-frontend-5l44.onrender.com/)
I've just launched Weaver, a webapp for generating stories. [Try it out!](https://weaver-frontend-5l44.onrender.com/)

## [Graph neural diffusion](https://github.com/etiennedyer/grand)
For my honours project I've been working on GNN models, mainly based on the [GRAND](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10934) framework. So far I've implemented GRAND-linear in Pytorch and will be trying to reproduce their numerics. <br/>

## [Starting to work on the Vesuvius Challenge](https://github.com/etiennedyer/vesuvius)
I've been developing an autosegmentation tool as part of the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/). It uses DBSCAN for initial segmenting, and I'm currently working on implementing a step to correct low-confidence regions according to data from high-confidence regions using Bayesian inference. <br/>

## [An n=1 trial on the effects of Vyvanse](https://etiennedyer.github.io/pages/vyvanse)
I ran a 30-day trial to figure out the effect my ADHD medication has on my productivity and mood.

## [Lead-acid battery recycling and Dodd-Frank 1502](https://leadbatteries.substack.com/p/from-conflict-minerals-to-clean-lead)
This is a piece I wrote about the relationship between demand-side regulation like Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank act and lead policy.

## [Predicting Population Size](pages/pool.md)
This is a program I wrote in Python to answer questions of the type "If I sample from a pool 100 times, and 1 object appeared 3 times,  2 objects appeared twice, and every other object appear once, what is the most likely size of the pool?" (which I later learned biologists know as the [mark and recapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_and_recapture) process to estimate population sizes). It uses a Monte Carlo algorithm and recursive search to estimate the most likely pool size your sample came from.

## [The Angel Problem](pages/angel.md)
I got an undergraduate research grant to study the [angel problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_problem) under Nadia Lafreni√®re and Assaf Shani. I've developed an interactive tool in Python to explore the problem and illustrate parts of the proof. \
