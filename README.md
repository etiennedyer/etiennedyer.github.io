## What I'm working on

**Liquidity risk:** using Monte Carlo methods to model the behaviour of a portfolio, with individual assets and liabilities correlated to macro indicators to evaluate the probability of bankruptcy. Currently just a demo, working on automating data fetching and implementing a GUI.

**[Narcissistic personality disorder:](/projects/npd.md)** there hasn't been much research into what causes NPD on a social scale, so I've been aggregating and analyzing studies.

**ULAB recycling:** I'm working with [students at the university of Chicago](https://leadbatteries.substack.com/) on reforming policy in Nigeria surrounding lead-acid battery recycling. It is a very toxic industry that's quite hard to regulate effectively, but the upsides to making thing a bit better are pretty considerable.
