## [The Angel Problem](pages/angel.md)
I got an undergraduate research grant to study the [angel problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_problem), as described by John Conway. I've developed an interactive tool in Python to explore the problem and illustrate parts of the proof. \

## [Predicting Population Size](pages/pool.md)
This is a small program I wrote in Python to answer the following question: "If I sample from a pool 100 times, and 1 object appeared 3 times,  2 objects appeared 2 times, and every other object appear 1 time, what is the most likely size of the pool?" (which I later learned biologists know as the [mark and recapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_and_recapture) process to estimate population sizes). It uses repeated simulation (i.e., Monte Carlo) to estimate the likelihood your specific repeat frequency came from a pool of size *z*.

## [Lead-acid battery recycling](https://leadbatteries.substack.com/)
I'm working with students at the university of Chicago on reforming policy in Nigeria surrounding lead-acid battery recycling; this is a Substack where we write about what we've learnt.
